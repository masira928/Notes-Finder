# Notes Finder Project:

Welcome to my **Notes Finder** project! This is a beginner-level Python project designed to search for specific words in multiple text files and provide detailed information about their occurrences.

## Features

- **Single File Search:** 
  - Find all occurrences of a user-entered word in a specific text file.
  - Provide detailed information including the verse number, file name, and the complete verse.

- **Multiple Files Search:**
  - Find all occurrences of a user-entered word across multiple text files.
  - Provide detailed information for each occurrence including the verse number, file name, and the complete verse.

## Modules and Libraries Used

- **re (Regular Expressions):** Used for searching specific patterns (words or phrases) within the text files.
- **os (Operating System Interfaces):** Used for handling file paths and directories.

## Project Files

- **NotesFinder.py:** Main application script that performs the word search operations across the specified text files.
- **Ar-Rahman.txt:** Sample text file containing verses from Surah Ar-Rahman.
- **Ad-Duha.txt:** Sample text file containing verses from Surah Ad-Duha.
- **Al-Inshirah.txt:** Sample text file containing verses from Surah Al-Inshirah.

## How It Works

1. **Input:** The user is prompted to enter a word to search for in the text files.
2. **Search Operation:** The script searches for the word in the provided text files (`Ar-Rahman.txt`, `Ad-Duha.txt`, `Al-Inshirah.txt`).
3. **Output:** The script outputs detailed information for each occurrence of the word, including the verse number, file name, and the complete verse.
